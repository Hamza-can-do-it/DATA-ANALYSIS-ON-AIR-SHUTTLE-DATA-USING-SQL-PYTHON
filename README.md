# DATA-ANALYSIS-ON-AIR-SHUTTLE-DATA-USING-SQL-PYTHON
This report solves the Business problem and at the end of this file will present  analysis in the form of words with the help of data analysis.

Upon analysis of the chart, we observe that the number of tickets booked 
exhibits a gradual increase from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by a 
relatively stable pattern from July 8th until August, with a noticeable 
peak in ticket bookings where the highest number of tickets were booked 
on a single day.

The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airline. 
Increase occupancy rate:
Improve pricing strategy
Enhance customer experience

So we can get insight from the following chart that there are two aircraft out of nine which does not support business class. And there is one aircraft which has all three fare conditions like business economy and comfort

 It is worth mentioning that the comfort class is available on only one aircraft, the 773. The CN1 and CR2 planes, on the other hand, only provide the economy class.
Rest supports only business and economy-class.Â 
We can observe there is one craft which has more fare for business and economy class as compared to other

The aircraft with the highest total revenue is SU9 and from Figure 3 it can be seen that the price of the business class and economy class is the lowest in this aircraft.

This can be the reason that most of the people bought this aircraft ticket as its cost is less compared to others. The aircraft with the least total revenue is CN1, and the possible reason behind this is it only offers economy class at very least price and it might be because of its poor conditions or less facilities.

Analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is critical for airlines seeking to maximize profitability.

Airlines can find areas for improvement and modify their pricing and route plans as a result of assessing these indicators. A greater occupancy rate is one important feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant seats.

The airline should revise the price for each aircraft as the lower price and high price are also the factors that people are not buying tickets from those aircraft. 

Economic downturn/recession:people tend to cut back on discretionary spending, including travel. Businesses may reduce corporate travel budgets, and individuals may postpone or cancel leisure trips. This can result in lower demand for airline tickets, leading to decreased occupancy rates. 

Solution: During economic downturns, focus on cost-effective strategies and offer flexible pricing options. Consider targeted promotions/discounts to stimulate demand.
